By applying and knowing why, students can reason through a problem, rather than memorize an answer that won't fit all cases.\n\nOur product encourages healthcare students to ask questions in a systematic way to learn the basic thought process behind treating patients.  We focus on the big picture rather than jumping straight to individual medications.\n\nWe currently have 2 prototype apps (for 2 different disease states) for both iPhone and Androids.  The future QuestionMed app will be a hub for many different disease states, all accessible from 1 app.\n\nProduct: www.questionmed.co", "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/QuestionMed_App", "high_concept": "Understand the treatment thought process.", "facebook_url": "", "updated_at": "2014-10-13T01:35:46Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/508267-40c4a9594b96b847887ec0751b876642-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1412984948", "company_size": "1-10", "name": "QuestionMed", "created_at": "2014-10-10T23:49:13Z", "linkedin_url": "", "blog_url": ""}, {"status": null, "abilities": {"intro": {"has": false, "can": false}}, "crunchbase_url": null, "video_url": "", "company_url": "http://www.themedicalroundtable.com", "company_type": [], "locations": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/westport", "display_name": "Westport", "id": 2263, "name": "westport", "tag_type": "LocationTag"}], "quality": 4, "id": 507920, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/the-medical-roundtable", "screenshots": [{"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/362/413362-5c45b47c0a68ac780a5bad4565cb107f12a468c7.jpg?1412959975", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/362/413362-e592e10fe894a0a64b76b79074fca75600ec3b38.png?1412959975"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/365/413365-faf955053775bfdfa52db22e19399aabd06de6f9.jpg?1412960079", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/365/413365-c763fc8f04ba65b0ee1445f112ea2526e3c9b312.png?1412960079"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/366/413366-4917f3d885a01f7102ddf963a5bd2c9215133bb3.jpg?1412960230", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/366/413366-714dbb4c83567e94486128f2f83ddc021426d1b0.png?1412960230"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/367/413367-e3905fbc5ad5425ebddbf78d58fb98466eb26574.jpg?1412960253", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/367/413367-c3e46f43ff3a10655bdfb504f1b7c4745b516125.png?1412960253"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/368/413368-5cec1fc103feb466800724bdd96126735299e6e7.jpg?1412960330", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/368/413368-f84b1afb6afc84175b3a6aacc8b354f3fe9edc0c.png?1412960330"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/370/413370-59b220e40795d1f725a1f9dc8941e911fcc910dd.jpg?1412960348", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/370/413370-759c7254e869435a315002ce476ba8107b475d44.png?1412960348"}, {"thumb": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/thumb/000/413/371/413371-07d7eee2bb2a2355c6d3365475d0cbc65bd2f404.jpg?1412960371", "original": "https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/413/371/413371-f7136f283e0ef7c004c9d6222922df5d9f9ccb6d.png?1412960371"}], "follower_count": 2, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/507920-1177b225a3ed11863a372bc8f4adc8e1-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1412958428", "markets": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/pharmaceuticals", "display_name": "Pharmaceuticals", "id": 23, "name": "pharmaceuticals", "tag_type": "MarketTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/medical-devices", "display_name": "Medical Devices", "id": 30, "name": "medical devices", "tag_type": "MarketTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/health-care-information-technology", "display_name": "Health Care Information Technology", "id": 175, "name": "health care information technology", "tag_type": "MarketTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/physicians", "display_name": "Physicians", "id": 8956, "name": "physicians", "tag_type": "MarketTag"}], "community_profile": false, "product_desc": "Healthcare professionals don't have time or interest in reading \"high science\" but want to remain updated on current medical evidence through trusted sources -
