In case the patient denies the reminder, system automatically allows him/her to reschedule and sends a push notification to the first patient on the waiting list, if there's any, filling what would be an empty slot on the doctor's agenda. Patients can access the progress of the agenda, allowing them to program themselves for the delay of the queue, reducing the patients' waiting time.
