We allow high school students to interact within the context of high school micro-communities and affinity groups to which they are associated with. Our central thesis is that intimate micro-communities actually lead to the purest form of expression and engagement, and that is what we are set out to do for all high school students across the nation.\n\nThe Smack High movement has taken the nation's teenage audience by storm. We have 100+ HS volunteers helping curate the teenage voice on a day to day basis, and over 9,400 \"SmackHigh Reps\" across these 24 states doing more than 450 million timeline impressions per month.\n\nThe Smack High mobile app will scale and automate our initiative on a more localized, school to school and group to group level.
