We have also developed an award winning application for the blind and visually impaired called TapTapSee ( http://taptapseeapp.com ) which won the prestigious Access Award for 2014 from the American Foundation for the Blind.  CamFind has processed over 13 million visual searches since launching in April 2013 and all major media claimed that the app is far superior to Google Goggles.  \n\nImage Searcher offers its incredibly accurate image recognition to businesses and developers through its API. Our long term goal is to gain significant market share in the $300B+ search market by continuing to lead the way in visual search while there is still little competition, and also to be the leading provider of image recognition to corporations and retailers and therefore targeting the $25.65B image recognition market.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/camfind", "high_concept": "Google the Physical World with your Smartphone by Taking a Picture", "created_at": "2012-12-18T06:23:09Z", "updated_at": "2015-02-19T19:04:47Z", "company_url": "http://www.CamFindApp.com", "follower_count": 366, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/147916-b8deb919f93a9b1f68ce355aa728ac42-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1424372682", "quality": 7, "id": 147916}, "tagged": {"bio": "Investor @coupons-com, @getaround \u2022 Studied at @cornell-university", "name": "N.
