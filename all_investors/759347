Traditionally, sleep apnea diagnosis has required sleeping overnight in a sleep clinic. \n\nWith our product, you just set your smartphone near your bed, click one button, and go to sleep. Sleep doctors are available through Wink to review sleep studies, discuss the best treatments with patients, and order prescriptions. We've partnered with treatment suppliers to ship the prescribed treatments directly to patient's homes.\n\nEven when diagnosed by a traditional clinic, most patients (40-60%) will abandon treatment usually due to small technical problems. We provide lightweight communication channels between health professionals and patients to provide vital troubleshooting help in the first weeks of treatment.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/wink-health", "high_concept": "Digital Sleep Clinic", "created_at": "2015-08-24T22:28:58Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-16T18:39:07Z", "company_url": "https://winkhealth.com", "follower_count": 85, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/810531-dc3bade11dc057b529a22cef3ba4e073-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1440455334", "quality": 7, "id": 810531}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founder Wink Health.
