We believe in events. It\u2019s where culture is created, relationships are forged and sometimes new loves are sparked. Events are life, and going to events is living.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. We\u2019ve all heard of \u201cconvenience fees\u201d and \u201cservice fees\u201d. These fees have become accepted in our culture because we have had no other choice. It\u2019s a problem for everyone, including you.\n\nWhen an organizer puts on an event, they have two options:\n\n - Absorb the service fees, which minimizes their profits.\n-  Pass the service fees onto the ticket buyers, resulting in fewer people going to events.\n\nThis is the problem our team has set out to solve. Picatic is a free online ticketing and event registration platform that empowers organizers to bring people together by removing unnecessary service fees.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple.\n\nThis is why we do what we do.
