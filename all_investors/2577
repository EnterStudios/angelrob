Despite the high prevalence and significant quality of life burden of BPH, established treatments are limited to drugs, which have limited effectiveness, and surgery, which carries a high risk of sexual side effects. The Spring device uses a mechanism known to relieve BPH symptoms with a unique design that enables it to avoid the complications associated with prior solution attempts. Urologists can deploy the device in a simple, office-based procedure that is faster and more painless than any existing therapy.
