Action sports athletes have nothing. We're building quantified self for the action sports demographic. Companies like GoPro (valued at $2.25B) have shown that this demographic has disposable income and is willing to spend it to improve their experience.\n\nDeep down our core expertise is sensor signal processing. In action sports like surfing, skiing, and skateboarding the interesting data comes from fast, complicated motion that requires more than just GPS. Often times what's interesting depends not on one's body, but on what the equipment is doing. \n\nAnd while the thought of tracking G's may sound cool, that's not what users want. They want easy to understand, beautifully laid out data. We take data dozens of times a second from 9-axis inertial sensors +  GPS and make it easy to understand.
