Through automation and efficiency improvements, medical providers have more time to spend on direct patient care which improves medical outcomes.  Our system further improves care by sharing data across multiple sites and providers and facilitating communication between providers, patients, and family.  For instance, Sally, in California, can access real-time information and see how her mom is doing in Ohio.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/medpac-technologies", "high_concept": "Web/mobile
