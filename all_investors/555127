To cover our costs, we charge sellers a 5% fee at sale, and we offer buyers optional finance and insurance products such as extended warranties. Therefore, if you\u2019re buying through Tred, you\u2019ll get a lower price than you would from the dealership, and if you\u2019re selling through Tred, you\u2019ll get a higher price than you would from the dealership.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/tred", "high_concept": "The smarter way to sell your car.", "created_at": "2012-06-09T18:05:26Z", "updated_at": "2015-03-05T13:51:45Z", "company_url": "http://tred.com", "follower_count": 1308, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/96232-a62f170a008bd39cc865fe6af8e5c6c6-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1421187386", "quality": 9, "id": 96232}, "tagged": {"bio": "Managing Partner at Fraser McCombs Capital and McCombs Partners", "name": "Tony Rimas", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/tonyrimas", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/555127-medium_jpg?1405725865", "follower_count": 85, "type": "User", "id": 555127}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 2248870}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-03-31T16:42:18Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/112274-a70a1c499449338b2d2ca571d9be2455-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1377011754", "name": "Smart Picture Technologies ", "product_desc": "Smart Picture Technologies (SPT) has engineered a unique, powerful and patent-pending mobile technology platform that allows users to capture and share Smart Pictures.
