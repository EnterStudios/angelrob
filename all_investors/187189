Our platform makes that part easier by giving college coaches and scouts the ability to assess an athlete's full complement of skills rather than sifting through a list of hopefuls. We categorize the athlete based on needs commonly characterized by college coaches and scouts, thus saving time and money to identify a fit. To keep the athlete in front of the college coach or scout after a tournament ends, we partner with athletic organizations that run tournaments to generate video content for the athlete, extending the exposure of the athlete. With the rise of social media as the primary way to communicate, we help open up the communication lines by making it easier to \"follow\", \"friend\" or \"DM\". This will assist the college coach and scout to recruit the athlete, and for the athlete to research the team culture and personality of a program based on social media presence.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/tapeplay", "high_concept": "Where athlete get seen.", "created_at": "2015-01-26T22:20:42Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-18T18:10:14Z", "company_url": "http://www.TapePlay.com", "follower_count": 4, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/590599-488773cef05943f330e2fc0b36e6776a-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1422310837", "quality": 4, "id": 590599}, "tagged": {"bio": "Active early stage investor individually and with Hyde Park Angels.
