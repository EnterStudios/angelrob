Podo is the first app-controlled, \u201cstick-and-shoot\u201d camera so that what you capture is up to you and not the length of your arm.\n\nPodo uses a proprietary \"sticky\" pad to stick on surfaces like glass, walls, wood, etc. to give you the perfect hands-free shot. The Podo smartphone app shows you a live preview of the shot so it always turns out how you want. You can take a photo, video, or time lapse, which Podo will send to your phone over Bluetooth. It's the hassle-free, stranger-free way to get any shot, any angle. \n\n#EverybodyIn.\n\n\u2022\"Top Startup\" at Plug and Play Fall Expo 2013 \n\u2022\"Audience Choice\" at O'Reilly Solid Conference 2014 \n\u2022Semi-finalist \"Top Startup\" at Web Summit in Dublin 2014 \n\u2022\"Top Startup\" at Global Brains Conference in Japan 2015 \n\u2022SVIEF 2015 Innovation Award \n\u2022Highway1 portfolio company in SF\n\n@PodoLabs", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/podo-labs", "high_concept": "Wireless Cameras for Your Phone", "created_at": "2013-04-28T03:17:56Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-18T07:39:46Z", "company_url": "http://www.podolabs.com", "follower_count": 301, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/200754-babd86464288c52f55e4ed66b0d1c997-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1398791037", "quality": 8, "id": 200754}, "tagged": {"bio": "Oracle alum (87-96), Zip2 alum, first employee at multiple startups building and leading engineering team.
