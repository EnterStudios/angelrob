Unlike regular GPS devices, TrackR uses a new form of GPS technology called Crowd GPS.  When an item goes missing with a TrackR device attached, all TrackR enabled phones will begin to search for the item.  If another user comes nearby the item, that user's phone will ping our server which will then update the item's owner with the new GPS coordinates.
