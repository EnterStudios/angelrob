Talkbox is often confused with Auto-Tune, a computerized pitch correction technology, that is primarily used in the studio and prevents improvisation in live performance.  The sound of the talkbox and Auto-Tune are immensely popular, having been featured in iconic hits across multiple genres with hundreds of millions of records sold.\n\nElectroSpit has totally reinvented the talkbox, fixing it\u2019s numerous problems and making the sound and experience more accessible to consumers.
