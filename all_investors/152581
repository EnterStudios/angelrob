The answer we started with is that each student should work one-on-one with a mentor who keeps their motivation high and sets work standards. \n\nOver 2,000 students agree: Thinkful is the best way to learn online for skills to advance your career. We now combine a project-based curriculum with a community of peers as well as a one-on-one mentor, but it all ties back to that original thesis: learning is a human endeavor, even online. Remember your favorite teacher? Thinkful exists to bring that to online education, to create more of the moments when teacher and student come together in active, passionate, and engaging acts of learning.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/thinkful", "high_concept": "Online school for a better career", "created_at": "2012-07-23T16:48:26Z", "updated_at": "2015-01-12T17:28:26Z", "company_url": "http://www.thinkful.com/", "follower_count": 113, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/107449-28c8e7b10e3ce2bb13f0a261a0e81118-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1421083701", "quality": 7, "id": 107449}, "tagged": {"bio": "Co-Founder @thinkful.
