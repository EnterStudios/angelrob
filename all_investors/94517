If they participate, their energy reductions can be sold into the markets as additional generation. Ohmconnect hooks into users' wifi thermostats, electric cars, and smart devices to automate these reductions. \n\nOur users are presented with a clean visualization of where their energy is coming from and where their energy is going.
