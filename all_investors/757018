Morgan, I have been a crucial contributor to the turnaround of a single-stock derivatives business that was facing severe structural issues. By collaborating across different groups and directing new initiatives, I have helped the group build its revenue base from $3 mln in 2011 to $60+ mln in 2014. I was selected to trade my own sector book almost two years earlier than is typical. Outside of J.P. Morgan, I was selected to join Empire Angels, an angel group which seeks to invests and supports early stage technology venture. I have led due diligence on three companies and have been able to closely connect with the companies outside of the fundraising process, as well. I believe my experience in finance and angel investing has prepared me very well to contribute to a technology company.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 46, "bio": "Angel Investor  @empire-angels, Derivatives Trader @j-p-morgan-1 , Alum @duke-university-1", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": "", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "Neel Vora", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/product_manager", "display_name": "Product Manager", "id": 80487, "name": "product_manager", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/strategy-3", "display_name": "Strategy", "id": 151275, "name": "Strategy", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/operations-1", "display_name": "Operations", "id": 129175, "name": "operations", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/neel-vora/17/430/460", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
