The problem is most severe in server-side software that ingests real-time data, and needs to respond to a very large number of concurrent requests at low latencies. Parallel Universe facilitates software that is harmonious with modern hardware -- with multi-core and multi-cache, with the storage hierarchy and the IO-to-processing ratio -- rather than software that fights the hardware at every turn.
