The intuitive design allows anyone, from a new entrepreneur to a corporate campus, to start growing produce locally. Freight Farms makes farming a real possibility in places where land is scarce or the environment doesn\u2019t allow year round growing. \n\nVertical Growing -- Freight Farms utilizes vertical growing to create a high density growing environment that is perfect for the small footprint of our retrofitted shipping container. By growing vertically, farmers can double or even triple yields achieved by traditional horizontal production. Each tower has 7\u2019 of open growing space, giving the farmer the flexibility to control plant spacing and the type of crop grown.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/freight-farms", "high_concept": "Local Food, Global!", "created_at": "2012-04-14T18:40:30Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-23T21:20:06Z", "company_url": "http://www.freightfarms.com", "follower_count": 265, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/83184-d7a6b2be6d416ba2658a46c9d804f8f9-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1403020341", "quality": 9, "id": 83184}, "tagged": {"bio": "Arbitrage Entrepreneur", "name": "Brian DeRosa", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/j-brian-derosa", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/275700-medium_jpg?1405556642", "follower_count": 60, "type": "User", "id": 275700}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 869371}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2013-09-25T01:09:26Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/75239-47953236961306f25a607b6f399d1c19-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1405360940", "name": "Wefunder", "product_desc": "We're a competitor to AngelList, but focused on letting everyone invest as little as $100, no matter how wealthy. \u00a0This will be legal by October 2015 when the JOBS Act is implemented.\n\nIf you're looking for a job: http://wefunder.com/jobs\n\nTo view our fundraising profile or to invest in us: http://wefunder.com/wefunder", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/wefunder", "high_concept": "We help everyone invest as little as $100 in their favorite startups", "created_at": "2012-03-10T06:14:17Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-04T07:30:02Z", "company_url": "http://www.wefunder.com", "follower_count": 256, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/75239-47953236961306f25a607b6f399d1c19-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1405360940", "quality": 9, "id": 75239}, "tagged": {"bio": "Arbitrage Entrepreneur", "name": "Brian DeRosa", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/j-brian-derosa", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/275700-medium_jpg?1405556642", "follower_count": 60, "type": "User", "id": 275700}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 869367}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 60, "bio": "Arbitrage Entrepreneur", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": null, "facebook_url": "http://www.facebook.com/j.brian.derosa", "criteria": "", "aboutme_url": null, "investor": true, "name": "Brian DeRosa", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/angels", "display_name": "Angel", "id": 9300, "name": "angels", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/seed-funds", "display_name": "Seed Fund", "id": 9305, "name": "seed funds", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": null, "github_url": null, "behance_url": null, "blog_url": null}
