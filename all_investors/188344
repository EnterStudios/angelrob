I hired on as a software engineer, was promoted to Director of Platform Engineering in my first six months, then promoted to VP of Engineering in my first year. While my passion is software development, I often end up in leadership roles.\n\nMost recently I was responsible for migrating the Tumblr environment from managed hosting to a Tumblr owned data center with minimal downtime and saving us hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. This required partial rearchitecting of the PHP application as well as building out some additional Scala backend services.\n\nPrior to this project I wrote all the initial backend service stack at Tumblr, creating a half dozen different systems handling everything from analytics to notifications.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "", "follower_count": 133, "bio": "Engineer \u2022 @facebook \u2022 Worked at @tumblr, @chacha, @compendium-blogware, @3gupload-com, @sprint \u2022 Studied at @purdue-university \u2022 GSoC \u2022 OpenSource contributor", "online_bio_url": "http://mobocracy.net", "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/bmatheny", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": "", "aboutme_url": "http://about.me/bmatheny", "investor": true, "name": "Blake Matheny", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/developer", "display_name": "Developer", "id": 14726, "name": "developer", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [{"display_name": "Hbase", "name": "hbase", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/hbase", "id": 74098, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Scalable Systems", "name": "scalable systems", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/scalable-systems", "id": 17249, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Software Engineering", "name": "software engineering", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/software-engineering", "id": 14766, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Distributed Systems", "name": "distributed systems", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/distributed-systems", "id": 18323, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Large-Scale Distributed Systems", "name": "large scale distributed systems", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/large-scale-distributed-systems", "id": 15651, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Algorithms", "name": "algorithms", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/algorithms-1", "id": 24952, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Hadoop", "name": "hadoop", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/hadoop", "id": 15605, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Scalability", "name": "scalability", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/scalability", "id": 27475, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}, {"display_name": "Software Development", "name": "software development", "level": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/software-development", "id": 15670, "tag_type": "SkillTag"}], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/bmatheny", "github_url": "https://github.com/bmatheny", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": "http://tumblr.mobocracy.net"}
