Whether you\u2019re a novice gardener or managing a small-scale organic farm, Edyn is there to take the guesswork out of gardening. Inserted in the soil, the Edyn Garden Sensor gathers and analyzes data about changing weather and soil conditions. The Edyn App displays this data as a real-time snapshot of your garden, and pushes alerts and suggestions to maximize plant health. A separate component, the Edyn Water Valve, uses the data collected by the sensor to smartly control your existing watering system, watering your plants only when needed. With advanced tracking technology and intuitive design, the Edyn smart garden system keeps you connected to your garden or farm so you can grow healthier plants.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/edyn", "high_concept": "Welcome to the Connected Garden", "created_at": "2013-05-29T03:44:46Z", "updated_at": "2014-09-15T18:29:11Z", "company_url": "http://www.edyn.com", "follower_count": 1042, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/213776-41030cf5d416a4da0eac77b6eba0c722-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1401896272", "quality": 9, "id": 213776}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founder and owner of University College Books.
