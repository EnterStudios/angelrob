The net result is actionable information provided to end-users, without requiring labs or PhD expertise.\n\nThat platform is able to detect any DNA or RNA sequence, pathogen, or virus, and can also perform genetic genotyping. With Chai, cutting-edge biotechnology is now available to global health practitioners, environmental monitoring applications (beach & water safety), industrial users like microbreweries, wineries, and agriculture, food quality applications (fraud/mis-labeling, GMO & hormone abuse detection), biohackers developing new microbes, and eventually consumers.\n\nIn addition to modern hardware (ethernet/wifi, touch screen), we will sell the required consumable test kits and reagents, which brings recurring revenue to the business model.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/chai", "high_concept": "Democratizing Biotechnology", "created_at": "2014-12-08T23:06:17Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-03T23:16:13Z", "company_url": "http://www.chaibio.com", "follower_count": 445, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/553044-e5a50c9b5618f6d1ee147ba612b7a134-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1428514565", "quality": 8, "id": 553044}, "tagged": {"bio": "Initial team at GolTV, Inc., founder a Transactility, support member of the jPOS.org project.", "name": "Constantino Voulgaris", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/cvoulgaris", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/157247-medium_jpg?1405537188", "follower_count": 21, "type": "User", "id": 157247}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 2590893}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-05-25T01:43:55Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "name": "Transactility", "product_desc": "Transactility provides commercial licensing and support services for the jPOS.org project. \n\njPOS is a Java\u00ae platform-based, mission-critical, ISO-8583 based financial transaction library/framework that can be customized and extended in order to implement financial interchanges.\n\nIt is the de-facto Open Source implementation of the international ISO-8583 standard giving users greater strategic freedom and lower costs.
