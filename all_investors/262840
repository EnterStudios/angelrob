The majority of men will experience symptoms of this disease at some point in life. BPH, also known as prostate enlargement, leads to urinary straining, frequency, urgency, and sleep disruption. Despite the high prevalence and significant quality of life burden of BPH, established treatments are limited to drugs, which have limited effectiveness, and surgery, which carries a high risk of sexual side effects. The Spring device uses a mechanism known to relieve BPH symptoms with a unique design that enables it to avoid the complications associated with prior solution attempts. Urologists can deploy the device in a simple, office-based procedure that is faster and more painless than any existing therapy.
