Our vision is not to teach the world to code, but rather to help people better understand and use technology, and to build the confidence needed to become more productive in the modern workforce.\n\nOur courses focus on teaching marketers how to use coding to execute A/B tests, scrape APIs, and implement tracking code. Or teaching designers how to build their own landing pages. Or teaching project managers how to communicate better with their developers.
