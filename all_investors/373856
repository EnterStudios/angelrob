After too many unfulfilling meals at the end of long work days, we insisted there be a better option. Instead of choosing between quick, greasy takeout or elaborate, expensive restaurants, Sprig combines the best of both into wholesome, delicious, convenient food you can trust.\n\nWe launched in November 2013 serving dinner to one neighborhood in San Francisco. Our customers immediately connected with our vision and word spread quickly. A year and a half later we\u2019ve served over half a million meals to customers across San Francisco and Chicago. Now we're focused on bringing Sprig nationwide, and ultimately worldwide, because everyone deserves to eat well.\n\nYelp: http://www.yelp.com/biz/sprig-dinner-on-demand-san-francisco-2\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sprig", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/sprig", "high_concept": "Eat Well", "created_at": "2013-04-14T02:13:31Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-11T23:08:15Z", "company_url": "http://www.sprig.com/", "follower_count": 1348, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/195210-efc3d718df3be08260fdb18e7b2a9852-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1438892654", "quality": 10, "id": 195210}, "tagged": {"bio": "Investment banker focused on providing merger & acquisition advice and raising capital for growing consumer & retail companies.", "name": "John LeVert", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/john-levert", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/373856-medium_jpg?1405621947", "follower_count": 67, "type": "User", "id": 373856}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1101789}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2013-12-08T20:54:51Z", "startup": {"community_profile": true, "thumb_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "name": "William Blair", "product_desc": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/william-blair", "high_concept": null, "created_at": "2012-03-08T08:54:52Z", "updated_at": "2012-03-08T08:54:52Z", "company_url": null, "follower_count": 19, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "quality": 4, "id": 74842}, "tagged": {"bio": "Investment banker focused on providing merger & acquisition advice and raising capital for growing consumer & retail companies.", "name": "John LeVert", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/john-levert", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/373856-medium_jpg?1405621947", "follower_count": 67, "type": "User", "id": 373856}, "role": "employee", "started_at": null, "id": 998238}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 67, "bio": "Investment banker focused on providing merger & acquisition advice and raising capital for growing consumer & retail companies.", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": "", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": "", "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "John LeVert", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/angels", "display_name": "Angel", "id": 9300, "name": "angels", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-levert/40/68a/511", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
