Mobile-first is already disrupting the space, but no dating company has automated the process of setting up the dates in the real world.  Matchmaker Cafe has invented technology for the scheduling of dates which sends them to local cafes for a 20 minute experience.  We charge a service fee once the date is confirmed. Our research has proven the concept of the pay-per-date model.
