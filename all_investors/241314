I have fully supported myself with a competitive market salary for my credentials for the past ten years and hope to take Camperoo from a cash cow company into a highly scalable exciting, high-growth tech company.", "mined_roles": {"per_page": 50, "last_page": 1, "total": 2, "startup_roles": [{"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-03-31T22:59:41Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/354949-e2d795e4e85405c9f9edf88a62beb76e-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1403073122", "name": "Guesty", "product_desc": "Property management in the cloud for vacation rentals\n\nManaging your vacation rental is a lot of work.
