Our online platform allows users to get personalized information about their immigration options, find and compare qualified legal providers, and save up to 80% on legal fees through our self-serve workflow tools. By streamlining and simplifying the process we empower consumers and businesses to access quality professional services more easily and affordably than ever before -- like TurboTax and Redfin did for the tax and real estate industries, respectively. Immigration legal services is a $10 billion market.\n\nOver time we will leverage the same blueprint to similarly guide the immigrant community through other related integration opportunities (e.g. building credit, paying taxes), leveraging data from the immigration process to provide our users with highly personalized education and a trusted services marketplace. The immigrant community has $2 billion in purchasing power but is deeply undeserved.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/bridge-us", "high_concept": "Making immigration easy and affordable.
