My first job was with a startup in San Francisco (implementing the \"Minitel\" in the Bay Area). I then travelled the world with DHL (postings in Eastern Europe, Hong Kong, Brussels, Denmark) and ended up with a line management role responsible for 1000 employees and an \u20ac80M budget. \n\nIn 2006 & 07 life threw us a curve ball and both my son and I got cancer within a year.
