Even if users wish to continue searching the likes of Zillow or Trulia, buyers can take RealSavvy with them via a browser extension that not only allows users to pin to boards shared with spouse, family and agent; but, they will even be notified they come across an online listing with an incorrect status (e.g. Zillow says For Sale yet RealSavvy accurately informs the user that the home is under contract through its direct MLS feed).", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/realsavvy", "high_concept": "The Social Way to Find a Home", "created_at": "2014-07-29T21:57:14Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-07T03:04:07Z", "company_url": "http://www.realsavvy.com", "follower_count": 100, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/448606-59098aaa9ff316c729d1d166a689350c-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1406671030", "quality": 7, "id": 448606}, "tagged": {"bio": "Graduated from UT Austin with a BS in Computer Science.
