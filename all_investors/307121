Through interactions with Betaspring Mentors and select audiences, each startup polishes their company pitch and demo to present to investors and potential partners throughout the session, concluding with a series of launch events during week 12. \n\nBy the conclusion of the program, companies are well-positioned to attract follow-on funding or have built a path to profitability wherein they can operate without additional investment.  \n\nApply thru F6S at http://betaspring.com/apply", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/betaspring", "high_concept": "mentorship-driven startup accelerator program for technology and design entrepreneurs", "created_at": "2012-01-17T23:52:39Z", "updated_at": "2014-01-22T00:43:02Z", "company_url": "http://betaspring.com/", "follower_count": 2162, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/34297-140dc43d37b23f2af80d2fcb0a9193fa-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1363721003", "quality": 7, "id": 34297}, "tagged": {"bio": "Managing Partner of @betaspring, top 15 accelerator in US.
