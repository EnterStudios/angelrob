I will read 200 scientific papers in a matter of days to get my head around and issue.  I will question every model in existence and test in every manner. It is all about Chess, Stratego, and dimensional instability.  I am smart enough to troubleshoot but not so smart I can't fix.  I recognize the smartest person and the most unbalanced person in a room and keep it to myself.  I like team players and those that really strive for success.  I avoid self actuators - they are no fun to be around in business.  Always look for better, faster, cheaper and generally very disruptive in one or more ways.  Not afraid of hard work, persistence, tenacity, determination, and I don't start without a clear path to a finish.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "Advisor, Strategic Investor, acquisition, Inventor\nBackground\nARPA-E (DOE) 2010\n5 time INC. 500 - 94-98\nUS National Business Person of the Year (SBA, 98)\nInternational Plastic Design of the Year, 02\nR&D 100 award 09\nSuccessful Serial Entrepreneur\n2 years of profits w/first start-up\nSuccessful exits\n", "follower_count": 1496, "bio": "Investor, Advisor, Serial Entrepreneur, Inventor, Adventurer, New Technology & Science Enthusiast, National Business Person of the Year & 5 Time Inc 500 list+\n\n", "online_bio_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossyoungs", "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/rossoyoungs", "facebook_url": "http://www.facebook.com/ross.youngs", "criteria": "Connections to Entrepreneurs, Investors, Mavens or Mentors that are experienced, creative, successful, balanced, communicative,  problem solvers, connected, resourceful, respectful, visionary, inventive, environmentally minded, socially conscience, or those who appreciate or pursue those qualities.", "aboutme_url": "http://www.Biosortia.com", "investor": true, "name": "Ross Youngs", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/advisors", "display_name": "Advisor", "id": 9299, "name": "advisors", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/angels", "display_name": "Angel", "id": 9300, "name": "angels", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossyoungs", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": "https://plus.google.com/108809463085824016098"}
