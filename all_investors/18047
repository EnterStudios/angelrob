My focus is on product development, design, and growth; at both the seed-stage (conduit, ambient) and growth companies (zynga, teamtalk). \n\nI've been building social internet companies since the late 90s when I designed a series of early internet communities around best selling books. Then spent the go-go \".com\" days building an online sports media company internetsoccer.com, managing product, growth, and content as COO during the rapid rise, sale to Teamtalk, and subsequent IPO.\n\nFrom there I relocated to Boston and was part of the early team at MIT Media Lab spinoff Ambient Devices, a pioneering \"internet of things\" company. Subsequently, I was Founder, CEO of Conduit Labs, backed by CRV and Prism and sold to Zynga after three years. I joined Zynga as GM, scaled Zynga Boston, launched Indiana Jones Adventure World, reaching 40m monthly users at peak, and recently left following the IPO to join Spark Capital.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "My primary drive is on working with world-class people trying to do truly risky, new, interesting things capable of becoming lasting institutions.
