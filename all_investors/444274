As friends take turns answering questions, they unlock the insights the other has shared and build their three-part Wonder score -- in effect, a \"social FICO.\" This reciprocity loop is naturally viral, as proven in our early 2015 public beta. Our new app builds on the beta with new technologies like shadowgraph and frictionless SMS invites.\n\nWonder has raised $1.4M from Jonathan Teo (General Catalyst/Benchmark/Google, early investor in Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram), Chris Kelly (Chief Privacy Officer at Facebook), Lloyd Carney (CEO Brocade), Ed Ojdana (CEO FreeCreditReports.com), and others.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/wonder-app", "high_concept": "Personal reputation platform, 360 feedback, \"give to get\" viral loop", "created_at": "2013-11-22T09:51:43Z", "updated_at": "2015-06-18T09:35:59Z", "company_url": "http://www.wonderapp.com", "follower_count": 64, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/298561-94d4a160f1059f05dc1cb99d0f73ea75-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1433016545", "quality": 7, "id": 298561}, "tagged": {"bio": "been doing startupy stuff since shortly after graduating MIT in '94.  had my first big exit with CourseAdvisor in '07.  have been dabbling in angel investing ever since.", "name": "Marc Bejarano", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/beej", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/444274-medium_jpg?1405677486", "follower_count": 25, "type": "User", "id": 444274}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1774285}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2013-09-04T17:35:27Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/174812-ee50eca8f53b220fba8f7b57eab6733f-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1392071138", "name": "Written", "product_desc": "Creating successful content is not easy, especially with: increased competition for attention, expanding consumption and delivery models, and audience fragmentation just to name a few.
