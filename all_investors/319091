Wi-MM's products represent the intersection of M2M, cloud-based real time wireless, and social fitness.\n\nSana Communications provides microwave/RF/radio design and development services to a wide range of clients including military subsystem, microwave radio, instrumentation, and consumer product manufacturers. This work combines microwave and RF design experience from component to system level, with mechanical design and process and manufacturing knowledge. Projects can range from simple single function hybrid circuits, softboard components, or waveguide elements, to complex integrated subsystems. Activities in recent years include higher levels of integration of RF circuits with digital hardware for signal source, modem, and transceiver applications. Many projects also include small to moderate volume deliverable hardware which is either produced in-house or with manufacturing partners.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "", "follower_count": 13, "bio": "Founder & CTO @ Wi-MM\nConsulting Engineer @ Sana Communications \nWireless Product Development Specialist\nEx Avantek, Celeritek, Netro\n", "online_bio_url": null, "twitter_url": "", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "Les Levitt", "roles": [], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/les-levitt/1/a74/859", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
