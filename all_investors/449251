Data is transferred wirelessly to an online dashboard where you can track your progress and get exercise advice. Smaller than an iPhone, the glossy, portable Aim was designed to fit comfortably in your palm. You don't need to wear the Skulpt Aim; just press it against the muscle you wish to measure, and get data in less than a second. Sync it with your phone, share data with your friends or trainer, create challenges, and improve your fitness.\n\nAim\u2019s design has already made Skulpt an International CES Innovations 2014 Design and Engineering Awards Honoree.
