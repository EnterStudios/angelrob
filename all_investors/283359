I started with a traditional finance path.  UPenn/Wharton => Investment Banking (Merrill Lynch) => VC (VantagePoint Venture Partners). I changed paths in 2007, and got to work with a great group of founders and previously successful entrepreneurs to launch HealthCare.com, which evolved to BrokersWeb. We scaled that revenue to over $50M in 2011 (and was nicely profitable), before a successful sale that year.  It was a nice outcome.  I moved back to NYC.  I still had to itch to build companies, and co-founded ContactUs.com in 2012.  We self-funded, and have gotten this business of the ground quickly. We're growing a user base, and love our prospects. In 2014, I relaunched a new HealthCare.com to build a new product-focused search application to help consumers find better healthcare and make better healthcare decisions.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "Scaling HealthCare.com.
