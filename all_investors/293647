At its peak, we were serving approximately 100 dynamically optimized impressions per second across dozens of publishers. Adtuitive was sold to Etsy in 2009. During my tenure at Etsy I was responsible for key pieces of infrastructure in Etsy's data cycle which were used for analysis and powering various products. I developed novel search interfaces for browsing, such as the Etsy Taste Test, and helped improve the conversion performance of Etsy's front-facing search engine through disciplined experimentation. I built a number of novel recommender algorithms which provided significant conversion lifts in split tests as well. Recently, I've been building iPhone apps as a way to sharpen my design skills until I find the next thing.
