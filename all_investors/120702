There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We have done it in a way that is accessible to the average online merchant.\n\nThe next piece is education. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. \n\nFinally, we\u2019ve built the marketplace.
