You can store it in Hadoop, MongoDB, Cassandra, and lots of other places. But if you want to perform analytics on modern data, then you are forced to homogenize it, dumb it down, and make it fit into tables, where you must use SQL or SQL variants like Hive to perform analytics on it.\n\nThis process is extremely time-consuming, expensive, and brittle.\n\nPrecog rejects the notion that you have to adapt your data to your 30 year old analytics technology. Instead, Precog is next-generation infrastructure that lets you natively analyze modern data types, without the need for coding (\"MapReduce\") or ETL of any kind.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/precog", "high_concept": "Deep Insights on Diverse Data", "created_at": "2012-03-14T13:13:53Z", "updated_at": "2014-04-09T21:10:12Z", "company_url": "http://precog.com", "follower_count": 910, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/76155-a20caa2b50a9be81f9afec7b9c018c59-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1331733354", "quality": 10, "id": 76155}, "tagged": {"bio": "Investor, Operator, Advisor; Previously Ventures Director @undercurrent, & co-founder of @precog ; @techstars alum.", "name": "Jason Spinell", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/jasonspinell", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/106188-medium_jpg?1440338752", "follower_count": 973, "type": "User", "id": 106188}, "role": "founder", "started_at": null, "id": 508654}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": "Ventures Director", "created_at": "2013-02-12T18:34:41Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/60812-35ed8be8049584c0ccaf3f0467d887e6-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1366229626", "name": "Undercurrent", "product_desc": "We believe that you can\u2019t solve 21st century problems with 20th century solutions.
