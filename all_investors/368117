Our sensor continuously and accurately tracks respiratory parameters (such as inhalation and exhalation time, apneic events, etc.) and activity (steps, gait, posture) in realtime, streaming raw data to a smartphone or watch. Each day we collect, store, and process over 2^32 data points.\n\nOur first product, a consumer wearable available at www.spire.io, uses respiratory patterns to infer a wearer\u2019s state-of-mind (tense, calm, focused). A complementary app provides feedback that lowers tension and increases calm and focus in everyday life. Clinical applications of the device and technology are currently being piloted.\n\nSome early customers feedback:\n@trevin: \"Day 1 experience with @spire_inc has been terrific.
