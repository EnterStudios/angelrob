Deep content is the soul of the video itself: image patterns, text & transcripts + web crawled references are analysed and converted into searchable, structured form. We focus on everything you can see and hear in a videos.\n\nWe created a study to determine our accuracy, and benchmarked it to leading commercial video engines (AmazonIV, Google Play Store, Youtube Movies, IMDb).
