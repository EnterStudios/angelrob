Very useful for playing in a live band and especially guitar lessons.   \n\nOur latest product that will be offered soon is called NiceScore.  It is a patent pending digital arranging system that allows music directors to enter the number of musicians in an ensemble, the instrument make-up of the ensemble, and even the proficiency of each musician.  It then produces a custom score that highlights top players, gives easy parts to lesser players and eliminates the need for editing for the music director.
