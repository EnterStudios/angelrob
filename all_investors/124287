We're building a better way for talent and companies to find and vet each other.\n\nTraditional credentialing is becoming an increasingly poor signal -- resumes aren't a good arbiter of ability, and more and more people are going outside the system to learn to code. Despite that, if you're an engineer who doesn't look great on paper, the odds of you getting in the door are slim. And even if you do, some hoop jumping has to happen before you get to the actual technical interview. During the interview process itself, there is no feedback loop for either party. Candidates don't find out why they got rejected or what they did well on. On the company side, interviewer onboarding is haphazard, interview questions don't get any real vetting, and interviewers don't have visibility into how they presented themselves or their company.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/interviewingio", "high_concept": "Anonymous technical interviewing platform", "created_at": "2015-06-11T06:49:13Z", "updated_at": "2015-07-27T19:55:57Z", "company_url": "http://www.interviewing.io", "follower_count": 222, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/727286-e5e5b9e4a497b36817edf148099f2957-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1438026953", "quality": 8, "id": 727286}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founder of ZMedia in 1998, acquired by VCLK (now CNVR).
