Our Wi-Fi enabled Lightpad is the first product of its kind.  Competitively priced and easy to install, it provides the convenience of controlling your lights from your smart phone from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Plum LightPad connects directly to your home WiFi network without the need for additional bridges or gateways.  The initial setup of the dimmer is as easy as sending or receiving a text message.  You simply launch your Plum app and answer two questions to provision the dimmer. What room is the Lightpad located and what would you like to name it?\n\nThe Plum LightPad features an intuitive, multi-touch, touch pad interface. Simply tap on or off.  Swipe up or down with one finger to change the intensity of the light. Multiple dimmers communicate with each other directly over WiFi. Use 2 fingers to control multiple lights.  When you go to bed or are leaving the house, the pinch gesture on any Plum LightPad will turn off all the lights in the house.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/plum-the-light-switch-reinvented", "high_concept": "A leading team disrupting the connected home market", "created_at": "2012-06-01T23:48:51Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-04T07:22:13Z", "company_url": "http://www.plumlife.com", "follower_count": 728, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/94672-23429a99a427ba1d6f14e70085f508bb-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1395778706", "quality": 8, "id": 94672}, "tagged": {"bio": "I'm a geek and I love the IoT", "name": "Pablo Mendoza", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/pablo-mendoza", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/577873-medium_jpg?1405736062", "follower_count": 22, "type": "User", "id": 577873}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1294127}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 22, "bio": "I'm a geek and I love the IoT", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": null, "facebook_url": null, "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": null, "investor": true, "name": "Pablo Mendoza", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/angels", "display_name": "Angel", "id": 9300, "name": "angels", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/seed-funds", "display_name": "Seed Fund", "id": 9305, "name": "seed funds", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pablo-mendoza/19/373/79", "github_url": null, "behance_url": null, "blog_url": null}
