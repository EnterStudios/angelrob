We're building modern banking using cutting edge software and data science to reinvent lending. \n\nOur job is to give Canadians a better way to borrow: one that\u2019s cheaper, faster, and more convenient than getting a loan from a bank or carrying a balance on a credit card. We leverage the power of technology to bring together middle class Canadians seeking loans with money from private investors, all in a convenient online environment that guarantees timely, personalized service and competitive rates.\n\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/grouplend\u00a0\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/grouplend\u00a0\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/grouplendhq\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/grouplend", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/grouplend", "high_concept": "Modern technology meets archiac banking", "created_at": "2014-01-14T04:09:32Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-07T00:48:28Z", "company_url": "http://www.grouplend.ca", "follower_count": 49, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/322845-9794cb681c1ee53f2f18e022dbf70d92-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1438823765", "quality": 5, "id": 322845}, "tagged": {"bio": "", "name": "Lance Tracey", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/elty-1", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/128486-medium_jpg?1405529637", "follower_count": 245, "type": "User", "id": 128486}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1724767}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-09-22T18:46:24Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/322845-9794cb681c1ee53f2f18e022dbf70d92-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1438823765", "name": "Grouplend", "product_desc": "Grouplend is the new generation of finance.
