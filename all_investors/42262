When students forgo textbooks, their academic performance suffers and fewer graduate. The institutions also suffer, losing credibility and their biggest source of revenue, tuition. In this $18b industry, faculty and administrators are scrambling for viable alternative content options.\n\npanOpen uses faculty curated open source content and combines it with the best learning technology available in one seamless, easy to use platform.
