What room is the Lightpad located and what would you like to name it?\n\nThe Plum LightPad features an intuitive, multi-touch, touch pad interface. Simply tap on or off.  Swipe up or down with one finger to change the intensity of the light. Multiple dimmers communicate with each other directly over WiFi. Use 2 fingers to control multiple lights.
