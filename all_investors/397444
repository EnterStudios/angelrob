That\u2019s the reality for most musicians. Instrumentalists and singers need to hear and interact with all the parts of the music they're learning. But they rarely can because it costs $50 an hour to play with one other person.\n\nWe\u2019ve developed the only solution that enables people to play with all the parts they need in an interactive, lifelike setting.\n\nOur first app, Cadenza, enables you to practice your instrument with a full orchestra. The orchestra listens to you and adapts to your tempo in real time, allowing you to improve your expressiveness and musicality.
