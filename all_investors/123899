We achieve this by aggregating shipments, and choosing the optimal carrier for each leg of the journey. We provide merchants with a US-based 'Ships From' as well as 'Return To' address. This gives overseas sellers  the 'virtual presence' they need to compete with local retailers. This makes buying direct from an international seller as hassle-free as buying from Amazon.\n\nBoxc logistics services have helped merchants grow sales by up to 10X in some verticals.
