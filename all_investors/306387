Further, online music properties are busy building glorified blogs--sites centered around written content that appeals to the whopping 2% of avid music fans who actually read about music.\n\nMOX is for that other 98% of the digital native population.\n\nOn MOX you'll find a music news every 30 minutes with a real-live host. MOX minimizes \"decision paralysis\" by featuring a lean-back, scheduled experience. We stream the latest music videos, VJs, interviews, and live sets, 24/7. \u00a0The concept of MOX is simple: bring back music television, focus on the music digital natives love, and put it where they already consume content: online, mobile, and other connected devices.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/mox-1", "high_concept": "MTV for 2013: a 24/7 programmed video stream with hosted electronic music news and videos.", "created_at": "2012-10-24T22:51:19Z", "updated_at": "2013-11-28T01:09:46Z", "company_url": "http://mox.tv", "follower_count": 89, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/132031-5f454aa1916476bb7af3e3174f6b3ace-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1366752207", "quality": 6, "id": 132031}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founder Wellspring Growth Partners\n\nI've been dealmaking in tech for 20 years.
