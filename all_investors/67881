Once files are pushed to the network, they are safe even if the user\u2019s own device loses internet or power, breaks, is stolen, or otherwise destroyed.\n\nSpace Monkey provides easy access to data through a simple Space Monkey Folder, from any device including iOS and Android mobile devices, Windows, Mac and Linux clients, as well as any other web browser enabled technology from any connected location in the world.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/space-monkey", "high_concept": "Beyond the Cloud", "created_at": "2011-04-08T07:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-24T21:53:07Z", "company_url": "http://spacemonkey.com", "follower_count": 1077, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/13779-a2f34777456e7e235236b7931acffd44-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1377001781", "quality": 10, "id": 13779}, "tagged": {"bio": "Principal at AXIOM Multi-Family Realty Advisors", "name": "Steve Donohue", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/steve-donohue", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/67881-medium_jpg?1405477154", "follower_count": 48, "type": "User", "id": 67881}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 68555}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 48, "bio": "Principal at AXIOM Multi-Family Realty Advisors", "online_bio_url": "http://www.axiommultifami.com", "twitter_url": null, "facebook_url": null, "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": null, "investor": true, "name": "Steve Donohue", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/angels", "display_name": "Angel", "id": 9300, "name": "angels", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-donohue/15/836/9a0", "github_url": null, "behance_url": null, "blog_url": null}
