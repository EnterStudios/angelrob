We believe this estimation to be wildly conservative due to the current model -- shippers buy hardware + infrastructure; Weft customers lease our hardware and we provide all the service, hardware, analytics, and infrastructure.\n\nWeft takes the current location and planned routes of all shipments on the platform and combines this information with historical data to identify likely bottlenecks and shrinkage areas + alert shippers to potential problems before they occur.
