While there was initial acceptance of our services among large brands, it became clear that communicating and promoting a new brand in China was cost prohibitive to all but the most deep-pocketed customer. From this thinking, AC began developing a cost-effective digital platform that is destination/city and lifestyle focused. XYD will launch with 3 destinations: Atlantic City, Boston and NYC. We plan to add Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco during the 1st quarter of 2014.
