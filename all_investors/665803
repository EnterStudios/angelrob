Sales associates can assist shoppers and if so, we track their customer assistance via individualized NFC tags on their badges that they tap on the customer\u2019s tablet. The store and sales associate get attributed credit for sales that are later completed online, if the sale originated in-store. This also enables retailers to properly track and attribute sales across online and offline channels.
