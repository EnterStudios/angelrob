We connect buyers and sellers, in an organized, efficient and safe environment. \r\n\r\nSellers sign up their car to see the price we'll sell it for, and we take it from there. We conduct a comprehensive pre-purchase inspection, take great photos and find you a buyer. Simply tell us when we can come inspect, and when we can come pick it  up to deliver it to the buyer. We even take care of transferring the title, with none of the hassle of negotiations. \r\n\r\nTo make sure buyers love their car, we offer a 10-day, no questions asked return policy. But sellers, don't worry. Once you've sold your car, it's sold. We take it back ourselves, and the money is yours to keep.\r\n\r\nAnd because we have no salespeople to pay or huge lots and showrooms to maintain, we guarantee that sellers get more and buyers pay less than at any dealer.
