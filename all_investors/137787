Previously,I helped bootstrap the mobile wine app Corkz which has received international acclaim from the NYTimes as \"the best all-purpose wine app available for serious wine drinkers\". During that period, I have also run a software consulting company that has seen 50% growth year over year. Prior to my entrepreneurial ways, I was one of the original leaders and part of the pitch team for the TabletPC at Microsoft. I also co-founded the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) concept there as well.\n\nGrandeMocha, another company I co-founded, was another mobile company focused on bringing mobile solutions to developed organizations. The company acted as an \"engineering VC\", where we invested mobile engineering experience in return for equity and revenue.
