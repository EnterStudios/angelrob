It drastically reduces the time you\u2019ll spend making plans and keeping track of people. If you know how to text, you already know how to use Cola.\n\nCola builds on the familiar texting experience by adding interactivity directly into messages. Scheduling, invitations, to-do lists, choosing a restaurant, tracking a group's location, and more, are included as interactive messages inside Cola. There\u2019s no need to download more apps or jump from app to app just to complete a simple task.\n\nBut Cola is also extensible, and third-party developers can add new message types into the product. It transforms messaging, while establishing an entirely new, and very powerful, software platform.
