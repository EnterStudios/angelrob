You\u2019re too busy to cook, don\u02bct have time to shop, and you\u2019re frankly out of ideas about what to make. Inevitably, you end up grabbing whatever is readily available (and often succumb to unhealthy choices), or find yourself eating the same thing at the same place again and again.\n\nMunchery allows you to order dinner, cooked daily, by our network of chefs. They use fresh ingredients for your meals (locally sustainable whenever possible). Each day, multiple chefs create delicious entrees and complement them with thoughtful sides. Meals are delivered directly to your home or office that night. You save time and get an incredible meal that blows away traditional forms of takeout.\n\nServing the SF Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, and Los Angeles, . Order online, or on your iPhone or Android.\n\nhttps://munchery.com", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/munchery", "high_concept": "Wholesome Meals in a Snap", "created_at": "2011-02-17T07:44:18Z", "updated_at": "2015-08-06T02:06:26Z", "company_url": "http://munchery.com", "follower_count": 1203, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/2855-2376eeb4f97b7b354ec623e8de980111-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1383253417", "quality": 10, "id": 2855}, "tagged": {"bio": "Author, Entrepreneur, Investor, Advisor.
