These include the transactional email system, email blaster, push notif system, feeds storage, requests storage and many more. I also launched the zBar, a cross-promo banner which moved traffic around the Zynga network and was key to launching all of Zynga's original hit titles. All that somehow got me a bunch of patents around messaging and game distribution. It also meant I was extremely close to the core operations of Zynga as the key source of traffic.\n\nSince Zynga, I've been running a marketplace for high end motorsports parts called Level X Motorsports and launched a Kayak/Yelp for modern services called Fatberry.\n\nI'm also a somewhat rare MBA product guy who still actively codes and therefore meshes very well with engineering teams. Last year I volunteered to teach a full academic year of CS at Lowell High School in SF through the TEALS program.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": "I'm an operational, hands-on and get-things-done person that loves to learn by doing.
