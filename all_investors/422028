Consumers receive accurate, fair, and market-driven offers from actual dealers without the time, pain, and uncertainty typically associated with selling a used car.\n\nMaxTradeIn provides dealers with organic and exclusive leads at significantly lower and directly measurable acquisition costs. The dealer is able to acquire a \u201chot\u201d customer who is actively looking to either sell a used car and/or purchase a new car who has selected their dealership.
