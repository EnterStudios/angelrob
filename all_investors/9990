Now developers can add shipping from the US Postal Service, FedEx, UPS, and DHL into their apps in minutes. We believe that verifying addresses, checking rates, purchasing postage, and tracking packages should be as easy as possible. No one should ever have to endure multi-month integrations, deal with multiple shipping providers, or use APIs designed when SOAP was all the rage.\n\nEasyPost is changing the way shipping works. Every day, tens of thousands of EasyPost packages are delivered across the world.  We are saving developers countless hours of development and millions of dollars of shipping costs.
