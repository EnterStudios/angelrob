The obstacle in transferring natural products to the clinic is lack of a sustainable supply that nature cannot provide. The synthetic community has yet to show advances in synthesizing appreciable quantities of natural products in an economic fashion in terms of time, effort and cost of goods.\n\nAkanocure found the solution to the supply problem through its patented synthesis platform. For the first time, access to appreciable amounts of some of the most promising natural products against cancer is possible. Our first pipeline candidate is an inhibitor of invasiveness, metastasis, and relapse, which will be tested against advanced ovarian cancer as a first indication.
