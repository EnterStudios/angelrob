We make it simple for students to get what they need, delivered directly to their dorm room; starting with laundry, snacks, and essentials. While most delivery services such as Seamless, UPS, or local pizza shops are prevented from entering dorms due to the required security clearance, Parachute hires ambitious students who already have the necessary clearance to deliver the things their peers need. \n\nUltimately, we're building a marketplace between students who want flexible work on campus, and businesses that want to distribute their offerings within college campuses, where they currently don't have the necessary access to do so. For students, our app aims to create a contextual experience around the things they might need, when they might need them; kind of like \"Google Now\" for their real life, physical needs.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/getparachute", "high_concept": "Simple Campus Deliveries - True Last Mile Delivery Within Universities.", "created_at": "2014-12-17T19:24:34Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-14T08:08:51Z", "company_url": "http://parachute.co", "follower_count": 360, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/559672-dbd671aa8a1048d0ced2853f2c206ce9-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1440609784", "quality": 8, "id": 559672}, "tagged": {"bio": "rails and lisp hacker, bjj roller, startup enthusiast. slangin' kombucha at http://t.co/2eDWdoaaTM", "name": "Matt Knox", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/mattknox", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/755846-medium_jpg?1410558470", "follower_count": 167, "type": "User", "id": 755846}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 2770667}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": "Software Engineer", "created_at": "2014-09-12T23:14:29Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/32510-9098ee9c875ae9698c86d2bc6d6cb75b-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1431034474", "name": "Twitter", "product_desc": "Twitter is a real-time information network that connects you to the latest stories, ideas, opinions and news about what you find interesting.
