The net result is actionable information provided to end-users, without requiring labs or PhD expertise.\n\nThat platform is able to detect any DNA or RNA sequence, pathogen, or virus, and can also perform genetic genotyping. With Chai, cutting-edge biotechnology is now available to global health practitioners, environmental monitoring applications (beach & water safety), industrial users like microbreweries, wineries, and agriculture, food quality applications (fraud/mis-labeling, GMO & hormone abuse detection), biohackers developing new microbes, and eventually consumers.\n\nIn addition to modern hardware (ethernet/wifi, touch screen), we will sell the required consumable test kits and reagents, which brings recurring revenue to the business model.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/chai", "high_concept": "Democratizing Biotechnology", "created_at": "2014-12-08T23:06:17Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-03T23:16:13Z", "company_url": "http://www.chaibio.com", "follower_count": 445, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/553044-e5a50c9b5618f6d1ee147ba612b7a134-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1428514565", "quality": 8, "id": 553044}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founded Roy Talman & Associates, Inc. in 1982.
