These services run asynchronously, users simply visit a neighborhood convenience store (7-11), grocery store (Safeway), or gas station (Shell), or any other frequented location we're in. No coordination. No waiting.\n\nEach standard box configuration can make $1K / month just off of receiving packages (with 65% margins, more as we scale), with additional compartments and services like shipping, the potential is even higher. Swapbox users are hooked - We have extremely low churn (<1.5% monthly). \n\nThe opportunity: $15B lost just on missed deliveries in the US per year (postal itself is a $1T market). Every top 10 metro has the demand for at least 500 Swapboxes. \n\n20+ Swapboxes in SF so far, but that was just the test!
