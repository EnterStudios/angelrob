It augments windshields with unique cost-saving properties to reduce repair, fuel, and operating costs for fleet-driven businesses. Fewer windshield replacements not only reduce glass repair costs, but also eliminate unnecessary downtime to create additional room for revenue generating activities. Keeping solar IR heat out means the A/C uses up to 20% less fuel in summers and reduces degradation of a vehicle's interior to improve it's resale value.
