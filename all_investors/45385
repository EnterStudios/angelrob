Buddy solves the problem connected device vendors have of ingesting massive amounts of device data into their existing BI toolsets (none of which natively support IoT devices as data sources).\n\nIn as little as three lines of code on any connected device, we can:\n\n1) Host the telemetry data on servers in your choice of the US, EU, China, Brazil and soon Australia\n\n2) Provide real-time dashboards showing how devices are performing\n\n3) Perform queries on the data and then output into any BI tool-set a customer may use.\n\nWhatever your BI software - Buddy connects it with the connected devices you manufacture or manage.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/buddy", "high_concept": "Device Data Delivered", "created_at": "2011-04-10T22:41:27Z", "updated_at": "2015-07-22T23:33:21Z", "company_url": "http://buddy.com", "follower_count": 229, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/14034-a13d38b45fd92f873b09d29de8bf4240-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1350174481", "quality": 8, "id": 14034}, "tagged": {"bio": "Director at Amazon.
