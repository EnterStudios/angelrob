Cancer requires re-operation so frequently because surgeons lack tools to detect cancerous tissue during the operation.  \n\nLightpoint Medical is developing a novel molecular imaging technology to detect cancer in real-time during surgery. Our technology reduces the cost and size of a nuclear medicine scanner by 100-fold, enabling it to integrate into the operating room. Image-guided surgery has the potential to provide more accurate cancer treatment and thereby reduce the need for re-operation.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/lightpoint-medical", "high_concept": "Transforming cancer surgery", "created_at": "2013-01-25T11:05:52Z", "updated_at": "2015-03-24T07:35:50Z", "company_url": "http://lightpointmedical.com", "follower_count": 119, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/160216-cfc010514e38c224265fbf9639ad0759-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1404822414", "quality": 8, "id": 160216}, "tagged": {"bio": "Partner @orrick advising technology companies in Europe", "name": "Chris Grew", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/chris-grew", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/97106-medium_jpg?1405519703", "follower_count": 1078, "type": "User", "id": 97106}, "role": "attorney", "started_at": null, "id": 2046344}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-12-22T09:18:38Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/234614-e12f3f7d82d366dc2689fffce014459a-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1417701043", "name": "Onfido", "product_desc": "Onfido is disrupting the \u2018traditional\u2019 background checking model by removing human error and using technology to automate the background checking process.
