We love fitness videos; they're accessible anytime, anywhere and give people access to the best coaches at a reasonable price. But fitness videos are dated. They're still mostly sold on DVDs. Also, the production value often just comes across as cheesy and old school.\n\nSo at Cody more than half the company's focus is in producing fitness videos. We deliver them on our apps and the web, we work with popular, hip fitness talent, and we try our best to not be cheesy.\n\nThe biggest problem with fitness videos though is that they're a solitary activity. That's where fitness classes really shine. When you're not at your regular fitness class, people notice. Your instructor, your class buddies know. And when you're in class, they push you to go harder.\n\nThat's the second half of Cody. We build a social experience around our videos that connect you to the instructor and others taking the same class.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/cody", "high_concept": "Video-based fitness training with the world's top coaches and a supportive community", "created_at": "2012-08-23T23:59:59Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-18T03:10:23Z", "company_url": "http://www.codyapp.com", "follower_count": 93, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/117039-9e44427a5a381a23f6193407484930a4-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1426347300", "quality": 7, "id": 117039}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founded ATGStores.com in 1999 - sold to Lowe's Home Improvment 2012, Founded Architectural Details, inc in 1990- sold to private buyer in 2007, expertise in ecommerce, online advertising and business growth.", "name": "Gary Rubens", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/garyrubens", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/263455-medium_jpg?1405583062", "follower_count": 377, "type": "User", "id": 263455}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1395572}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2014-05-06T22:50:18Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/393670-4fc0b5aa2e421c9bad1e3dafc1a3b520-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1425243261", "name": "Decorist", "product_desc": "Decorist is the leading virtual home design platform.
