I\u2019ve worked for and managed high-performing product teams at Shape Security, VMware, and Cisco, where our team won the Cisco \u201cPioneer Award\u201d for most outstanding product launch.\n\nWhen not at work, I'm a serial adventurer. I've climbed the 7 Summits, including Mount Everest unguided, swam the 20-mile wide English Channel as part of a two-man relay, and rowed across the Arctic Ocean with a team of 4. In 2012 I received a Guinness World Record for \u201cLongest Arctic Ocean Row\u201d for our 1000 mile and 41 day row.\n\nI have an undergraduate degree from Penn and MBA from Wharton, both with honors. \n\nI love to teach and speak publicly about my work and outdoor adventurers.", "mined_roles": {"error_description": "You are currently over your rate limit.", "error": "over_limit"}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 67, "bio": "Product guy and serial adventurer", "online_bio_url": "http://www.nealmueller.com", "twitter_url": "http://www.twitter.com/nealmueller", "facebook_url": "http://www.facebook.com/neal.mueller", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "Neal Mueller", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/product_manager", "display_name": "Product Manager", "id": 80487, "name": "product_manager", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "http://www.linkedin.com/nealmueller", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": "http://www.nealmueller.com"}
