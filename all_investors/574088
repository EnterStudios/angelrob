Our e-commerce solution allows customers to select from a weekly menu of recipes and we deliver all of the fresh ingredients and instructions needed to cook a gourmet meal at home in 30 min or less. Our recipes are designed by our Executive Chef, Jason Rosso, who is an award winning celebrity chef featured on Top Chef Canada and co-host on the Food Network\u2019s \u2018Recipe to Riches\u2019.\n\nWe believe there is a huge gap in the market for people that would love to prepare gourmet meals at home but don't have the expertise, time to research recipes and desire to waste leftover ingredients.
