In 2006, I co-founded Ustream, the largest live broadcasting video site in the world.  I lead an amazing team of people in SF, LA, Europe and Tokyo.\n\nPrior to the Ustream experience, I worked for the Ross Perot family doing real estate development and served my country as a officer in the US Army.  I always loved technology since the days of BBS's, Sysops, Usenets, MUDs, and Gophers.  In 2001 I graduated from West Point.  I'm happily married and have two great children (soon three!).\n\nMy startup life has allowed me to experience new challenges, meet amazing people and travel all over the world.
