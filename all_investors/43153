We were looking for companies that cared about responsible and local production, but found the search to be difficult, time consuming and confusing.\n\nThere are two groups of people - conscious consumers and responsible makers - who are looking to interact, yet have no simple solution to facilitate their connection and communication. MadeClose is the central, trusted location for these groups to connect easily and confidently.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/madeclose-1", "high_concept": "Developing the technology solution for conscious consumerism", "created_at": "2014-02-27T22:37:57Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-28T11:35:42Z", "company_url": "http://www.madeclose.com", "follower_count": 24, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/351938-98c0f2ef20156d3efa874d80cb9e7f00-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1424792974", "quality": 6, "id": 351938}, "tagged": {"bio": "Real estate developer @MillenniumPartners and angel investor.
