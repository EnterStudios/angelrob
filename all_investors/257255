You tell SHADOW what time you want to wake up, and arm the alarm when you go to bed. SHADOW uses a series of escalating alarms to wake you up. The gradual increase in volume helps you better remember your dreams by taking you through your hypnopompic state (the transition from asleep to awake) much slower than a standard alarm clock. \n\nOnce you\u2019re awake, you can speak or text your dream into SHADOW, if you choose audio we'll transcribe into text [realtime] and identify the keywords. We then apply a natural language process on the keywords to extract emotional sentiment and populate images that best represent your dream. The whole process takes less than five minutes.\n\nADVISOR | Kelly Bulkeley Ph.D.\nDream Researcher | https://vimeo.com/74685519\n\nADVISOR | Stephan Fabregas\nSleep Cycle Expert | https://vimeo.com/75964907\n\nADVISOR | Ryan Hurd MA\nLucid Dreaming Expert | https://vimeo.com/75763482", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/shadow-1", "high_concept": "A mobile application that helps you remember and record your dreams.", "created_at": "2012-09-10T17:51:11Z", "updated_at": "2015-01-16T21:51:50Z", "company_url": "http://WWW.DISCOVERSHADOW.COM", "follower_count": 143, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/121195-9577828562eaf49deb721938785d081e-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1357904593", "quality": 7, "id": 121195}, "tagged": {"bio": "Entrepreneur in the Entertainment and Digital Industry: 2 exists 1 private and 1 to PE ", "name": "Moj Mahdara", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/moj-mahdara", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/257255-medium_jpg?1405565071", "follower_count": 263, "type": "User", "id": 257255}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 1523414}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2013-06-17T22:49:09Z", "startup": {"community_profile": true, "thumb_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "name": "Zady", "product_desc": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/zady", "high_concept": null, "created_at": "2013-06-17T22:49:09Z", "updated_at": "2013-06-17T22:49:09Z", "company_url": null, "follower_count": 11, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "quality": 1, "id": 224074}, "tagged": {"bio": "Entrepreneur in the Entertainment and Digital Industry: 2 exists 1 private and 1 to PE ", "name": "Moj Mahdara", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/moj-mahdara", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/257255-medium_jpg?1405565071", "follower_count": 263, "type": "User", "id": 257255}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 711170}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2013-06-17T22:48:58Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/30586-64f2b6fc4c7755b53ab8cd29f0d9acdd-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1336439270", "name": "Circa", "product_desc": "Circa is a new kind of media company that enables readers to more easily consume, engage with, and follow the day\u2019s news by delivering comprehensive yet to-the-point coverage in a format tailored specifically for mobile lifestyles.\n\nOur apps provide bullet point, Cliff's notes-like news stories that gives readers the facts without all of the fluff.
