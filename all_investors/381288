RemoteScan was co-founded and owned 50/50 by me and my business partner, and run at 85% profit for 8 years. Millions of dollars of revenue poured in yearly until the company was acquired for cash (this is what is supposed to happen with start-ups). I can help others build, market and sell such things. I've done it twice, and now I am looking for new projects to invest in and help rapidly succeed. \n\nSince I was a kid have used about 30 computer languages to build ideas of my own and of others. Obsessed with learning, I can write software and build electronics for just about any project that comes along (and this doesn't mean delegating, it means I write code and bread-board and make sure it all works), but my most valuable skills to others are my writing ability, marketing knowledge and deal negotiating.", "mined_roles": {"per_page": 50, "last_page": 1, "total": 7, "startup_roles":
