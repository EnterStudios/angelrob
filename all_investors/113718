Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable.\n\nBut studying these sorts of custom events at massive scale is difficult, and before Keen IO, required a deeply specialized data engineering team.  We imagined a world in which any generalist software developer can wield event data powerfully well, and without such a specialized background.\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that we're a platform, not a product.
