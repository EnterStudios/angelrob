This segment requires capabilities that are unique to MPOWER: a non-FICO based credit score, school partnerships, and international servicing.\n\nLoans are 3 or 10-year, fixed-rate, and range between $2,000 and $25,000. MPOWER disburses payments directly to the university to cover tuition or university-sponsored housing, meal plans, or health insurance.
