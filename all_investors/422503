About a year and a half ago, my co-founder and I were dining a cash-only restaurant, only to be found cashless when the bill came. Fast forward a few months later and at the height of the on-demand economy, we created Nimbl \u2013 a mobile tech app/service providing cash access for consumers and SMBs. We scrappily put together a software team to build out the product, created an efficient and secure logistics system, on-boarded a team and launched beta simultaneously in NY & SF. We received great feedback from consumers of our product, plenty of press and attention from media outlets such as TechCrunch, Gigaom, etc. Shortly thereafter, we engaged in deep discussions with major retail arms of well-known financial institutions to potentially offer our service as an extension of theirs.", "mined_roles": {"per_page": 50, "last_page": 1, "total": 0, "startup_roles": [], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 41, "bio": "Created an on-demand company, scaled data/analytics operations at another, worked in investment banking and studied at Boston College.", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": "", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": null, "investor": true, "name": "Zachary Tai", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/operations-1", "display_name": "Operations", "id": 129175, "name": "operations", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}, {"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/product_manager", "display_name": "Product Manager", "id": 80487, "name": "product_manager", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachtai", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
