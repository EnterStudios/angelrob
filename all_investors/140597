We quietly watch in the background and can identify any security threats. In the event there is any serious activity we notify you and provide detailed steps needed to solve the situation.\n\nBy focusing on great design and user experience we have created a security product that can be used by everyone. You don't need to know anything about security to use Barricade . We are making enterprise level security available to all.\n\nBarricade is extremely easy to get started with.
