By allowing the customer to \u201cexperience\u201d the tour ahead of time, it creates a stronger emotional connection than a static listing can. Combining that with highly-targeted ads, we end up with conversion rates in the 5-6% range. This is extremely high for the industry, which allows us to cost effectively bid for clicks. \n\nThe interesting part is we only discovered the effects of video recently and should still be able to improve the efficiency of our listings & keywords as we evolve. We\u2019ll also benefit from network effects - instead of finding customers specifically for the tours we have like we do now (expensive), we can acquire an ordinary traveller and show them relevant tours we already have (much cheaper).", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/tripzaar", "high_concept": "A P2P Marketplace for Adventure Tours", "created_at": "2012-11-01T16:05:01Z", "updated_at": "2014-02-07T15:09:45Z", "company_url": "http://www.tripzaar.com", "follower_count": 44, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/133830-4c10a2a0a62232512bd6e535b2a31f01-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1372084737", "quality": 7, "id": 133830}, "tagged": {"bio": "One of the most successful investors in the Waterloo region.", "name": "Mike Stork", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/mike-stork", "image": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic.png", "follower_count": 98, "type": "User", "id": 14465}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 706695}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2012-12-06T01:12:55Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/25499-a81f63c5ac7413942eba2c21dea44467-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1346889982", "name": "Second Funnel", "product_desc": "Live campaign with Gap: http://gap.secondfunnel.com/summerloves/\nLive campaign with NastyGal: http://nastygal.secondfunnel.com/swim-city\n\nGo to market: a web-based landing page creation tool for digital marketers at retail brands.
