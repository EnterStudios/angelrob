In addition to individual coaching, mentoring, workshops, networking opportunities, events, and \u20ac25,000 in seed funding, the program especially stands out due to the two powerful companies behind it. Participating startups reap the benefits of close connections to Axel Springer SE, one of Europe's leading media companies, as well as to the Plug and Play Tech Center in Silicon Valley. An optional three-month extension at the Plug and Play Tech Center adds another dimension to the program, giving teams the chance to learn first-hand from their American forebears and collect American investment. The program ends with Demo Day, where startups have the opportunity to pitch to an elite audience of local and international venture capital firms for additional seed and Series A funding.\nApply now! www.axelspringerplugandplay.com", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/axel-springer-plug-and-play-accelerator", "high_concept": "The Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator serves as a booster for new ventures", "created_at": "2013-07-05T07:55:21Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-10T09:38:05Z", "company_url": "http://www.axelspringerplugandplay.com/", "follower_count": 223, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/230688-54108e20e911e5857a543e730df71054-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1392978611", "quality": 6, "id": 230688}, "tagged": {"bio": "Eugen is an investor and entrepreneur based in London, San Francisco, Moscow and Tel Aviv.
