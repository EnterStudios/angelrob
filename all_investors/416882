Videos are produced in less than 30 minutes. There's no need to download anything - it's all accessed through our web and mobile apps.\n\nVideo is ubiquitous and has never been more important than it is now. This is particularly evident in the music industry. Without compelling and engaging content online, artist's don't stand a chance. Up to now, it's been expensive, difficult and time-consuming for musicians to create all types of video content. Not any more. Rotor is the solution.\n\nRotor enables them to create their own videos quickly, easily and inexpensively. They simply upload their song, some video clips, select a video style and go. Rotor does the rest. Once they're happy with the results, they can download their video or share it on the platform of their choice. Rotor can even do lip syncing. Plus, fans can create their own versions of each video.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/rotor-1", "high_concept": "Make great music videos in minutes", "created_at": "2013-12-02T14:04:02Z", "updated_at": "2015-10-09T11:41:53Z", "company_url": "http://www.rotorvideos.com", "follower_count": 14, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/302830-ee81c932bd9ede8c83474167d79f8473-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1427894981", "quality": 5, "id": 302830}, "tagged": {"bio": "Ex-GreenParrot (sold to Google), ex-Google, now software architect at Rotor.", "name": "Hugh Denman", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/hugh-denman", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/416882-medium_jpg?1444394348", "follower_count": 5, "type": "User", "id": 416882}, "role": "employee", "started_at": "2015-10-01", "id": 3152103}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2015-07-09T17:02:03Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/434868-c96bc792dd893e8023bae943c39a1904-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1432660112", "name": "Level", "product_desc": "Level is a platform that enables any digital asset owner to create revenue from visual content.
