Customers range from SMBs to national chains like Lucky Strike Lanes, The Melt, and Buffalo Wild Wings. \n\nCredit purchases (like a jukebox, users pay to request songs). New deployments - including JetBlue's JFK terminal & 20 casinos - bring millions new listeners. \n\nLocation-based advertising.  Brands want to reach consumers at the point of purchase.
