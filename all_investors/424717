We are unique in the DevOps world since we're the world's first CI platform built natively on containers. \n\nOther key benefits are - <1 min setup, GitHub/Bitbucket integration, super fast builds, cross-platform and matrix builds, advanced container workflows, Docker Hub support, and integrated code quality analytics and trend visualization. You can automatically deploy to PaaSes like Red Hat Openshift, Heroku, AWS Beanstalk, and also AWS.\n\nBesides our multi-tenant platform, we also offer a Dedicated Hosts model where you can 'attach' your own on premise or cloud machines to your Shippable account. We then route your builds there, effectively giving you a dedicated build system with all the benefits of a cloud solution.\n\nShippable is part of the TechStars Seattle 2013 cohort!", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/shippable", "high_concept": "Ship code faster with an enterprise grade CI/CD platform built on Docker", "created_at": "2013-01-30T03:19:07Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-04T11:11:31Z", "company_url": "http://www.shippable.com", "follower_count": 283, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/162112-a54069e69c1c76a72e4335afd40be7a5-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1427926204", "quality": 9, "id": 162112}, "tagged": {"bio": "Founder HomeNeeds (an retail chain named Apna Bazar), co-founder iFusionIT", "name": "Vijay Beniwal", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/vijaybeniwal", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/743071196/picture?type=large", "follower_count": 10, "type": "User", "id": 424717}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 917831}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 10, "bio": "Founder HomeNeeds (an retail chain named Apna Bazar), co-founder iFusionIT", "online_bio_url": "http://Business Entrepreneur with engineering background", "twitter_url": null, "facebook_url": "https://www.facebook.com/vijaybeniwal", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": null, "investor": true, "name": "Vijay Beniwal", "roles": [], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": null, "github_url": null, "behance_url": null, "blog_url": null}
