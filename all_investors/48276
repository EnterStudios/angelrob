We call it The WayBetter Way\u2122.\n\nOur first product is DietBet, a game that motivates people to lose weight by betting on themselves. It works by providing group support, microgoals, and real rewards. And while there's money on the line, it isn't about betting. It\u2019s about believing in yourself, investing in your health, and sticking to your commitments.\n\nIt works. Since 2013 dietbetters have lost over 2 million pounds. Along the way, we\u2019ve paid out $10 million to winners.\n\nOur Chief Scientist is at Brown Medical School and with her we're integrating evidence-based practices. We also work with top health and wellness influencers: Jillian Michaels, Chris Powell, Tim Ferriss, and many more.\n\nThe best part is that we succeed when our users do. We've been making money since the day we launched and we're growing and hiring. We just raised capital.\n\nStay tuned in 2016 for new products in smoking cessation, fitness, sleep, and more.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/waybetter", "high_concept": "Bet On Yourself", "created_at": "2012-05-01T21:26:45Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-04T18:25:16Z", "company_url": "http://www.waybetter.com", "follower_count": 223, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/87270-5d9a9e362c9044e2c990ab426b6189f3-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1422542993", "quality": 8, "id": 87270}, "tagged": {"bio": "Board of Trustees, Save the Children", "name": "Sunil Sani", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/sunil-sani", "image": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic.png", "follower_count": 35, "type": "User", "id": 48276}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": "2011-09-01", "id": 620830}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2012-05-04T16:12:28Z", "startup": {"community_profile": true, "thumb_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "name": "DietBet, PrePlay Sports", "product_desc": null, "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/dietbet-preplay-sports", "high_concept": null, "created_at": "2012-05-04T16:12:28Z", "updated_at": "2012-05-04T16:12:28Z", "company_url": null, "follower_count": 4, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic_startup.png", "quality": 1, "id": 88013}, "tagged": {"bio": "Board of Trustees, Save the Children", "name": "Sunil Sani", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/sunil-sani", "image": "https://angel.co/images/shared/nopic.png", "follower_count": 35, "type": "User", "id": 48276}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": null, "id": 224163}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2012-05-04T15:49:57Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/27231-96b2add821dc918284081dde71a3e8c3-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1362667003", "name": "Docphin", "product_desc": "Docphin is the Bloomberg for Doctors.
