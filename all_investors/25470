The vast majority of consumers list \u201cvalue for money\u201d as their top consideration when making a travel purchase\n2.  Because getting the best value for money is a top priority, people are spending an increasing amount of time shopping for travel online. On average, consumers are now spending 14+ hours making more than 30 site visits before booking\n3.  Yet even with all this value-oriented shopping, consumers are reporting that they\u2019re unsatisfied. Only 50% of those prompted said that their travel dollars were \u201cwell spent\u201d.\n4.  The trends in items 2 and 3 above are not getting better.  They\u2019re getting worse.  Travel consumers are spending more time and getting less value.\n \nAt Dealbase, we want to help fix this mess.  We plan on making it easier for consumers to get the very best value on their trip, without major trade-offs or sacrifices.  There are hundreds of hidden travel deals and discounts out there.
