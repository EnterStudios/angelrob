Basically what we did is create the opportunity for anyone to be able to invest his/her money anywhere they want, doesn\u00b4t matter how much it is.  We are developing 3 more investment options in the future.  \n\nOur first investment option is called LAND.  Today is easier to buy a piece of land via Blastos than in person.  YOU CAN BUY PRODUCTIVE LAND FOR ONE CLICK.  Owning a piece of land and leaving there is not going to bring you any good, so we manage to turn that land into a farm.  We take care of everything, production, processing, commercializing, etc. This way your land will generate trimestral revenues for YOU.  Your revenues will depend on how the commodity behaves in the world market, like the Stock Exchange.  The cool thing is you can buy a piece of land now for only $350 and sell it any time you want by one click.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/blastos", "high_concept": "Amazing investment experience", "created_at": "2014-08-07T01:04:21Z", "updated_at": "2014-08-20T15:17:31Z", "company_url": "http://www.blastos.com", "follower_count": 7, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/455334-fc78c5555b8c43a4cfcfaeb62536d36b-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1407790720", "quality": 2, "id": 455334}, "tagged": {"bio": "Latin American Entrepreneur and Investor. \nFounded companies in Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare.\nMember of YPO, Aspen Institute and Abundance 360", "name": "Juan Bonifasi", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/juan-mauricio-bonifasi", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/706462-medium_jpg?1428603009", "follower_count": 17, "type": "User", "id": 706462}, "role": "board_member", "started_at": null, "id": 1582478}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 17, "bio": "Latin American Entrepreneur and Investor. \nFounded companies in Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare.\nMember of YPO, Aspen Institute and Abundance 360", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": "", "facebook_url": "", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "Juan Bonifasi", "roles": [], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
