Now. Locally) is an on-demand staffing platform for businesses to fill their immediate hourly or daily labor needs. \n\nWe solve the last mile staffing problem for Fortune 500 companies as well as Small-to-Medium businesses (think Coca-Cola merchandising, eCommerce fulfillment, Event staffing, Hotel housekeeping, etc). Wonolo allows companies to manage unpredictability by augmenting their existing labor force with hourly to daily Wonoloers who can come in within an hour and do the job. \n\nWonoloers are people who want the freedom of flexibility - the opportunity to choose when they work, where they work, for whom they work.\n\nWe believe that the traditional temp staffing model which is cumbersome, expensive and very manual, is ripe for disruption. We revolutionize staffing by removing the friction for both job requestors and job seekers. \n\nWe make on-demand staffing simple.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/wonolo", "high_concept": "on-demand staffing made simple", "created_at": "2014-04-10T20:52:38Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-04T07:07:22Z", "company_url": "http://wonolo.com", "follower_count": 437, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/377879-494a4296adb63987d90171fb302e6fa9-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1405059868", "quality": 9, "id": 377879}, "tagged": {"bio": "Co-Founder & CEO of Wonolo.", "name": "AJ Brustein", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/ajbrustein", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/247080-medium_jpg?1409198796", "follower_count": 107, "type": "User", "id": 247080}, "role": "founder", "started_at": null, "id": 1268155}], "page": 1}, "what_i_do": null, "follower_count": 107, "bio": "Co-Founder & CEO of Wonolo.", "online_bio_url": "", "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/ajbrustein", "facebook_url": "http://www.facebook.com/ajbrustein", "criteria": null, "aboutme_url": "", "investor": true, "name": "AJ Brustein", "roles": [{"angellist_url": "https://angel.co/ceo-5", "display_name": "CEO", "id": 151008, "name": "CEO", "tag_type": "RoleTag"}], "skills": [], "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajbrustein", "github_url": "", "behance_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
