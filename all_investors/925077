The video is automatically analyzed and  packed in a visually pleasing form reminiscent of a comic.  Videogram allows for a quick overview of a video at a glance & replaces video thumbnails on publishers landing sites/apps.

Much in the way that Soundcloud allows commenting for music. \n\nOur customer is anyone who publishes video. \u00a0A brand promoter is interested in how viral and how much mindshare are achieved. A commerce related publisher wants to use the video for monetization. All publishers want discovery, because if the video is not watched then it might well as not have been published.
