ClassDojo is one of the world's fastest-growing education technology products; it currently reaches 1 in 3 schools in the US, and is scaling globally fast.\n\nResearch shows that building behaviors like persistence, self-control and curiosity have a huge effect on test scores - as well as on incomes, health outcomes and dropout rates. So how do we create an education that not only builds academic knowledge, but also the character strengths that make people successful in life? That's what we're here to accomplish.\n\nClassDojo is backed by some great investors including Paul Graham, Ron Conway, Jeff Clavier, Yuri Milner, Matt Ocko, General Catalyst, Shasta Ventures, Felicis Ventures and others.", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/classdojo", "high_concept": "Building understanding between teachers, parents, and students", "created_at": "2012-01-18T05:37:30Z", "updated_at": "2014-10-22T19:36:55Z", "company_url": "http://www.classdojo.com/", "follower_count": 403, "hidden": false, "logo_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/58369-82fb0e203e635f49c4feea9b956caa53-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1347926854", "quality": 10, "id": 58369}, "tagged": {"bio": "Managing Partner at @learn-capital", "name": "Rob Hutter", "angellist_url": "https://angel.co/rob-hutter", "image": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/users/154713-medium_jpg?1405502737", "follower_count": 975, "type": "User", "id": 154713}, "role": "past_investor", "started_at": "2012-08-01", "id": 349565}, {"confirmed": true, "ended_at": null, "title": null, "created_at": "2012-07-29T06:04:24Z", "startup": {"community_profile": false, "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/78782-2507c7b2f57e6d53027999d2adc186d6-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1371592806", "name": "HireArt", "product_desc": "HireArt is a Y Combinator funded company taking on the $100bn/yr employment agency industry.
