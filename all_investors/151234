The program will instantly deliver a custom playlist comprised of music whose BPM corresponds to their desired footstep or heart rate. \n\nI introduced the software to Nike and Budweiser, and the marketing industry's first digital music technology and marketing agency was born.  I developed the code-for-content model which is now used by every record label, and have earned more than 20 tech, innovation and creative awards for music-centric campaigns powered by the software I developed.  I founded and ran the company for about 8 years.\n\nVerveLife (www.vervelife.com) manages tens-of-millions of transactions per month for global brands such as Quaker, General Mills, Hertz, Live Nation (Music Today), IMVU and many others.
