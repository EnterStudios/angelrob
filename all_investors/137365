Typically about 65-70% of photos are Klutter!\n\nOnce the Keepers are identified, Ruly finds the Highlights and edits them so they look great.  These are the fun shots because they tell a story and have the best photographic qualities. For example, they're the 25 best shots that customers show friends and family after a trip to Hawaii (even though they took over 400 in total).
